 * The models Volta has pictures of. MG's model name can carry the trim ("COMET EV EXCLUSIVE FC") and its series can be
 * a code ("E230"), so [pattern] is tried against both. The ZS Astor is a petrol car, not the ZS EV.
 *
 * MG can also send the trim alone, with no model word (a Windsor Pro came through as "Essence"). The trims that only
 * one model sells name it: FC and Play / Plush / Pace are Comets, Excite Pro and Exclusive Plus are ZS EVs, Exclusive Pro
 * and Essence Pro are Windsor Pros. Executive, Excite and Exclusive are sold on more than one model, so they stay
 * MG's own name.
 *
 * Only the Windsor's pack-energy reading has been checked against the car, so Volta learns the Windsor's battery size
 * from it. Other models report that figure on a different scale (a ZS EV's 50.3 kWh pack read as 71.8), so they use
 * [packKwh], the pack MG India sells, until their readings are checked. Null means not known yet.
